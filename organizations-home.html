								<h3>What is ESC Affiliation?</h3>
								<p>ESC affiliation is a process through which engineering student organizations at Berkeley demonstrate their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion within their organizations. All of our affiliated organizations have attended several mandatory trainings, stripped exclusive requirements from their applications, and provided ESC with feedback from their members regarding the state of club culture at Berkeley. In return, ESC provides these clubs with a wide range of benefits, including access to funding and publicity. Next year, ESC is looking to partner with the College of Engineering and expand this list of benefits, creating an even greater incentive for clubs to join this program.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
								<p>For years ESC has received complaints from students that the club culture at Berkeley is too exclusive and unwelcoming, a description that fundamentally opposes our understanding of the purpose of student organizations. As beneficiaries of campus resources paid for by tuition dollars, we believe that all clubs (including ourselves) have a responsibility to serve the student body. The purpose of ESC Affiliation is to reward clubs who are already fulfilling this role and entice other clubs to do the same.</p>

							<h3><a href=clubs.html>Our Affiliated Clubs</a></h3>
								<p>The Engineering Student Council at Berkeley has over 60 affiliated student organizations, including competition teams, honor societies, and community outreach groups. All of these clubs have enjoyed incredible success in their fields, and they have each committed to promoting an environment of diversity and inclusion both in their club and in the broader engineering community. <a href=clubs.html>Check out our affiliated clubs.</a> </p>
