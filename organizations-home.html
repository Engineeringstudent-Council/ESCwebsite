								<h3>What is Blue and Gold Certification?</h3>
								<p>Blue and Gold Certification is a process through which engineering student organizations at Berkeley demonstrate their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion within their organizations. All certified organizations have attended several mandatory trainings, stripped exclusive requirements from their applications, and reflected on ways in which club culture at Berkeley can be improved for all students. In return, these organizations are given access to a wide range of benefits, including funding, publicity, and other resources.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
								<p>For years ESC has received complaints from students that the club culture at Berkeley is too exclusive and unwelcoming, a description that fundamentally opposes our understanding of the purpose of student organizations. As beneficiaries of campus resources paid for by tuition dollars, we believe that all organizations (including ourselves) have a responsibility to serve the student body. The purpose of Blue and Gold Certification is to reward groups who are already fulfilling this role and entice others to do the same.</p>

					<h3>  <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/blue-and-gold-portal/home">The Process</a> </h3>
					<p> All certified organizations have gone through an involved process to assure they are meeting the standards of the program. Some key requirements are listed below, but you can also check out <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/blue-and-gold-portal/home"> this portal</a> for more information about the process.</p>

							<h3><a href=clubs.html>Certified Clubs</a></h3>
								<p>The Blue and Gold Certification program includes a wide variety of student organizations (competition teams, honor societies, community outreach groups, etc.). All of these organizations have enjoyed incredible success in their fields, and they have each committed to promoting an environment of diversity and inclusion both within their ranks and in the broader engineering community. <a href=clubs.html>Check out the full list of certified organizations!</a> </p>

											<p>All of our affiliated organizations are required to send their treasurers to one of our Treasurer Training every year, the purpose of which is to educate clubs on how they can apply for and spend funding granted by ESC. Due to the complexity of this training, we have included the slides on our website for the convenience of our affiliated clubs.<p>
