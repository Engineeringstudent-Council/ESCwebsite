							Thank you all for your patience as we finalize the details of this program. We have reviewed all feedback received during the Blue and Gold Town Hall, and we will be incorporating most of your suggestions into the program. We also greatly appreciate your feedback on how ESC as an organization can better serve the engineering community and its student clubs.
							<br> </br>
							While our initial goal was to provide you all with a final documentation of Blue and Gold by the end of the semester, obtaining administrative approval is taking longer than we anticipated. With that said, we anticipate <text style="font-weight:bold;">no major changes</text>  (aside from your suggestions) to the program as we presented it at the Blue and Gold Town Hall. For your convenience, we have included the slides from that event below should you wish to review them. Furthermore, we are able to provide you all with a concrete timeline going forward, which will hopefully ease any concerns that you might have.
							<br> </br>
							On <text style="font-weight:bold;"> July 5th, 2021</text>, the official Blue and Gold Certification Program will launch for the 2021-2022 school year. On this date, three things will be provided to all student organizations:
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:left;">
							<li>Detailed documentation for the program that includes (among other things) all the benefits and requirements of certification. These documents will be shared through a publicly accessible website, called the Blue and Gold Portal. </li>
							<br>
							<li>A link to a form through which your club will apply for certification (this form will be due on <text style="font-weight:bold;">August 6th, 2021</text>)</li>
							<br>
							<li>Dates and links for sessions of the program’s required trainings</li>
							
							</p>
							<p>
							This communication will be sent to your previous officer board, your current officer board, and (if applicable) the permanent email address that your club created for ESC affiliation. Our goal is that the Joint Committee will review all clubs’ applications before Golden Bear Orientation, so that all clubs who wish to be Blue and Gold Certified will be.
							<br> </br>
							If you have any follow-up questions or would like to provide additional feedback, please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:evp@esc.berkeley.edu?subject=Blue%20and%20Gold"> evp@esc.berkeley.edu.</a> Thank you all again for supporting this new initiative!
