						<h2>Affiliation Process</h2>
						<p>ESC Affiliation Application is now live for 2020-2021. ESC affiliation is now part of the Blue Gold Certification. Affiliation applications are due on April 26th, 2020 at 11:59PM. Please email us at <a href="mailto:communications@esc.berkeley.edu?subject=ESC%20Affiliation%20Question">communications@esc.berkeley.edu </a> for any questions you may have about affiliation.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Instructions</h2>
					<p>
						In order to become Blue and Gold Certified, your group must complete steps 1 and 2 listed below <b>by 11:59PM on April 26th, 2020</b>. Once your organization completes steps 1 and 2, please fill out the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gPOqb4i_kgegZPgwCAJpdKNcnrirMMM2" target="_blank">Initial Allocations application</a>. The Initial Allocations application is also <b>due by April 26th</b>.
						<br><br>If your organization does not get approval for steps 1 and 2, we will withhold your Initial Allocation until the necessary changes are made. Steps 3, 4, and 5 will be required throughout the year in order to keep your certification, however only steps 1 and 2 are required by April 26th.
						<br><br>Please note that access to funding is not the only benefit of becoming Blue and Gold Certified. If your organization wishes to stay in good standings with the College of Engineering and its affiliates, we highly recommend that your organization applies to become certified. Each step can be completed by following the links in this document or by consulting the “B&G Certification Materials” folder that was shared with you.
						<br>Path to Care TRAIL Certificate Program counts toward STEP 4 Requirement. There are two workshops (April 14th or May 12th). To get the cerficate, you will need to attend three training sessions. For information about the program, check out this <a href="https://care.berkeley.edu/prevention-first/trail-certificate/" target="_blank">link </a>. To sign up for the program, check out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVPBqVFIMCekjeI_q25a3r0tMu0neN0IgWg-OfBkvI6vovUg/viewform" target="_blank"> form </a>.
						<table>
							<tbody>
								<tr><td>STEP 1: </td>
										<td>Submit the Engineering Student Council Registration form, which can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJuERrk8bPyzl9kX1d6SLULoom1aMROXfv0QZjxUVDTwsuxQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">here</a>. This form will ask you to submit certain files pertaining to your group, including your Constitution and By-Laws, a continuity plan, a sample application, and a list of interview questions, so please have these documents at the ready when filling this form out. </td>
								</tr>
								<tr><td>STEP 2: </td>
										<td>Send <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEE34dXYwP2RWHjo62_jTUip30YwIkAF2cc1YZtjarnpt8IQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">this</a> survey to all members of your group. This is a demographic survey that must be completed by <b>at least 60%</b> of your group’s members.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr><td>STEP 3: </td>
										<td>Review the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12bqlwm-1z2X3HP0b9n1LfTed4CaB392ytM34sGXd5H8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">list</a> of mandatory events that a member of your group must attend, which can be found in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_vtaedFjz7s-Oq4QyxUGjXgqsaYbGL3x?usp=sharing" target="_blank">B&G Certification Materials</a> folder. Due to COVID-19, we will be updating this list with new required events, so please check back every few weeks. There will be at maximum two additional events that will be added to the aforementioned document. Organizations will be given a minimum of one months notice for any required events. By April 17th, we will have all of the mandatory events listed. </td>
								</tr>
								<tr><td>STEP 4: </td>
										<td>Submit proof that your club has completed sexual harassment training to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRP86DGAKgk_zqXhkHgapqZnNni6dxCTPsr6ZpzZf4JZRVDA/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">this form</a>. Ideally, this proof would be a sign-off from an organization that provides sexual harassment training such as Path to Care. Attending RSO signatory training, does not count toward this training requirement. The Engineering Student Council will provide at least one of these trainings per year for organizations to attend.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr><td>STEP 5: </td>
										<td>Once your group has received an email from ESC stating that your application has been approved, please put the official Blue and Gold logo (which will be attached to the email) on your website. In addition, if your group hosts an event using ESC/ESS funding or ESC/ESS facilities, all promotional graphics for that event must contain the Blue and Gold logo. If the logo has not been added two weeks after being approved, we will rescind your organizations’ acceptance.  </td>

					<h2> Clarifications/Updates: </h2>
					<h3>
					<li>2.1: 60% Requirement<h6>Membership is defined by the number of active members. Due to the varying definition of the term member and active member, the following criteria is in place.
						<br><br>
				 			<ul>Clubs with open membership (membership defined by being present at a meeting): 20% of active members and 60% of the executive board must fill out the form. If your organization has committee members, those members are classified as active members.</ul>
							<ul>Clubs with applications-based membership (membership defined by submission of an application): If there are no other constraints besides submitting an application. 40% of the members must submit a form.</ul>
							<ul>Clubs with restricted membership (membership defined by application and other criteria): 60% of members are still required to submit this form.</ul>
					</h6></li>
					<li>2.2: Privacy<h6> In a previous version of the Demographic Survey form, the disclaimer at the top of the form stated that email collection may occur. At no point does the form collect emails or any other identifiable information. The portion that require sign-in to the Berkelely email account verifies that the respondent is a UC Berkeley student. We have removed this portion of the disclaimer in the current version of the survey.</h6>
					<li>4.1: SVSH Training Deadline<h6> Implied in our deadline breakdown, this part of affiliation is not due any time soon. Getting approval from the affiliation application submission will be enough to be awarded Initial Allocation funds. As the funding is not fully released by the ASUC until the Fall semester, this part of the application will officially be due by September 20th.</h6>
					<li>4.2: Participation<h6> In terms of submitting documentation, if your organization hosts a sexual harassment training with Path to Care for your members, please ask the PTC coordinators to email us. If your organization has its members present at an ESC/PTC training, we will be checking at the end of the meeting. Your entire board will need to submit proof of attending a SVSH training. Your organization can substitute at MAX 2 general member's proof of SVSH training for 2 missing board member certifications.</h6>

					<h2> What are the benefits? </h2>
					<h3>
						<li> Initial Allocations Funds: <h6> These funds are the collective pool gathered from the ASUC and the College of Engineering. Through the Initial Allocations application, organizations can apply for these funds. This application is solely for undergraduate organizations. For graduate organizations, the ESC is working for the 2020-2021 to request funding from the Graduate Assembly and Engineering departments to simplify the process of requesting funds.</h6></li>
						<li> ESC/ESS Facilities: <h6> Engineering Student Council has one of the largest student organization spaces on campus. Being ESC-affiliated, allows organizations to store their materials in 120ABC Bechtel Engineering Center, to reserve 120B and 240 for club/corporate events, utilize the Bechtel patio area for events, and reserve equipment such as the ESC's projector and projector screen. </h6></li>
						<li> ESC/ESS Newsletter: <h6> One of the easiest ways to inform students about clubs events is through the ESC's and ESS's newsletters. These newsletter market to other ESC-affiliated organizations and undergraduates. </h6></li>
						<li> Engineering Student Events Calendar: <h6> One of the largest projects for ESC has been the creation of a central Engineering calendar that promotes all relevant engineering events happening on campus to engineering students. Becoming affiliated, grants your organization access to share events to this calendar.</h6></li>
						<li> Brand: <h6>Engineering departments and those affiliated with the College of Engineering refer to our website to verify if a club is within the College of Engineering, find organizations to help host events, and decide whether to give funds to an organization. </h6></li>
						<li> And more! <h6>Small things such as ease of fixing issues with the LEAD Center regarding finance. Our goal is that being affiliated with us will make it easier for your organization to focus on your mission statement.</li>
