										<h2>Past Events</h3>
											<h3>Faculty Panel - COVID 19: Building More Ethical and Sustainable Solutions May 2019</h3>

											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/covidpanel.jpg" alt="picture" /></a>
											<p>Seven excellent Berkeley faculty members joined the Engineering Student Council to discuss how engineering innovations impact the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Faculty members shared their own research, which ranged from improving hospital ventilators to changing airport operations. Attendees included Professors of CEE Jasenka Rakas, Scott Moura, and Khalid Kadir; Professors of EECS Michel Maharbiz, Robert Pilawa-Podgurski, and Bin Yu; and Professor of ME and BioE Dorian Liepmann.</p>

											<h3> General Meeting - CalZoom: Case Studies of Current Times September 2020 </h3>

											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/CalZoom.png" alt="picture" /></a>
											<p>For the first event of the academic year, the ESC wanted to address current events whose impact affects the community - three pressing issues were discussed: 1) Racism in Academia, 2) Political Participation in CoE, and 3) Accessibility and Student Advocacy During COVID-19. Participating students were split into these three groups and brainstormed solutions that could be enacted and applied to the College of Engineering. Dean Tsu-Jae Liu graciously joined the conversation and listened to student opinions.</p>
											<br></br>

											<h3>Poll-ar Bears: A Voting Workshop September 2020</h3>

											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/PollarBears.jpg" alt="picture" /></a>
