						<p> Engineers Week (EWeek) is a weeklong event comprising of various professional, social, and design-build activities.
							Though primarily catered towards the 3,600+ undergraduate engineers on campus, each year EWeek reaches over 8,000 
							students from a variety of majors and degree programs, and that reach continues to grow. Our theme for 
							this year is "World Carnival at Berkeley", and the celebration will occur from the Monday the 14th to Friday the 18th
							of February. Every day will feature two exciting events, all of which will earn you raffle tickets towards the end of
							EWeek giveaway. Prizes include an electric scooter, JBL speaker, Amazon gift cards, and more, so don’t miss out on the 
							action!
							<br>
							<br>
							Keep scrolling for more information on the main events that you can look forward to! </p>

					<h3 style = "font-weight: bold;"> Monday: Carnival Extravaganza </h3>
					<!--<img src="images/eweek2022/pre_eweek.png" align="right" width="200" height="600"> -->
						<p> It wouldn’t be the “World Carnival at Berkeley” Engineer’s Week if there was not a carnival at Berkeley. To kick off 
							an exciting week, we will have a Carnival Extravaganza with several classic carnival games to play from 11am-6pm on 
							February 14th. Come out and have the opportunity to earn a lot of raffle tickets that will increase your odds of 
							getting one of our exciting end of the EWeek giveaways. </p>

					<h3 style = "font-weight: bold;"> Tuesday: Design-Build Challenge </h3>
					<!--<img src="images/eweek2022/pre_eweek.png" align="right" width="200" height="600"> -->
						<p> In the spirit of both engineering and difficult carnival games, we are putting together a Popsicle Bridge Shake Table 
							challenge where students will build a bridge with popsicle sticks and hot glue. Once completed, the bridge will have 
							its structural stability tested on Cal Seismic’s shake table. The competition will be happening in Hearst Memorial 
							Mining 290 from 12-3pm on Tuesday, February 15th. Both statics and dynamics to deal with on this bridge! </p>

					<h3 style = "font-weight: bold;"> Wednesday: Top Dog </h3>
					<!--<img src="images/eweek2022/pre_eweek.png" align="right" width="200" height="600"> -->
						<p> From the outset of freshman year, golden bears come to know Top Dog as a staple of the city and a necessity on late nights. 
							On February 16th, at the Hearst Memorial Mining Circle, from 12-2pm delectable Top Dog hot dogs will be available for FREE. 
							Come enjoy an easy, accessible free lunch for the day!  </p>

					<h3 style = "font-weight: bold;"> Thursday: Movie Night </h3>
					<!--<img src="images/eweek2022/pre_eweek.png" align="right" width="200" height="600"> -->
						<p> Come unwind with the musical prowess of Hugh Jackman and the inspiring story of P.T. Barnum, the founder of the circus 
							which is often a key component of Carnivals. The movie will be starting at 7:30pm in Hearst Memorial Mining 290 on 
							Thursday, February 17th. Engineering coursework can be demanding so treat yourself to a fun night off! </p>
