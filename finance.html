										<h3><a href="https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley's Finacial Aid & Scholarships Website</a></h3>
										<p><a href="https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley's Finacial Aid & Scholarships Website</a> provides resources for applying to finacial aid and scholarships. Additionally, it has many resources to aid students in their financial success. <a href="https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/whats-new-financial-aid-and-scholarships">Berkeley's Finacial Aid & Scholarships COVID-19 Update</a><p>
										<h3><a href="https://ucbbffs.wordpress.com/about/">Bears for Financial Success</a></h3>

										<h3><a href="https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/cost-attendance-adjustment-request">Cost of Attendance Adjustment Request</a></h3>
										<p>Your financial aid eligibility is based on a standard cost of attendance, or student budget. We may be able to increase your budget—and your financial aid eligibility—if you incur expenses during the academic year that are higher than your standard financial aid budget. This is called a <a href="https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/cost-attendance-adjustment-request">Cost of Attendance Adjustment Request</a>. Please note that there is no COA Adjustment process for the summer term.<p>
										<h3><a href="https://scholarships.berkeley.edu/scholarships/type"> UC Berkeley Scholarship Connection</a></h3>
										<p>A surprising number of students fail to see that identifying scholarships can be one of the most important parts of the successful scholarship search. There are thousands and thousands of scholarships available to students through internet searches and scholarship guides, but no one student will every qualify for all of them. Even if one person were to qualify for all of them, though, most students at UC Berkeley probably don't have the time to apply for each and every one. For this reason, a well-defined scholarship search can be invaluable to students looking for some extra money to fund their education, research proposal, or community service project.
										The best and cheapest way to run a scholarship search is to find a good, reliable scholarship search engine (like  <a href="https://scholarships.berkeley.edu/scholarships/type">UC Berkeley Scholarship Connection</a> scholarship database.)
