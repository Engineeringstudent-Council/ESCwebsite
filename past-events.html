											<h2>Faculty Panel - COVID 19: Building More Ethical and Sustainable Solutions May 2019</h2>
											<div class="row gtr-150">
												<div class="col-8 col-12-medium">
													<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/covidpanel.jpg" alt="picture" /></a></div>
													<p>Seven excellent Berkeley faculty members joined the Engineering Student Council to discuss how engineering innovations impact the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Faculty members shared their own research, which ranged from improving hospital ventilators to changing airport operations. Attendees included Professors of CEE Jasenka Rakas, Scott Moura, and Khalid Kadir; Professors of EECS Michel Maharbiz, Robert Pilawa-Podgurski, and Bin Yu; and Professor of ME and BioE Dorian Liepmann.
											<br> </br>

												“The faculty panel was a great experience! I was able to sit down with great professors and get to know them on a personal level rather than just a classroom setting and create connections”

												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/CalZoom.png" alt="picture" /></a></div>
											<p>For the first event of the academic year, the ESC wanted to address current events whose impact affects the community - three pressing issues were discussed: 1) Racism in Academia, 2) Political Participation in CoE, and 3) Accessibility and Student Advocacy During COVID-19. Participating students were split into these three groups and brainstormed solutions that could be enacted and applied to the College of Engineering. Dean Tsu-Jae Liu graciously joined the conversation and listened to student opinions.

											<h2>Poll-ar Bears: A Voting Workshop September 2020</h2>

											<p>With 2020 being an important presidential election year, the Engineering Student Council created a workshop specifically highlighting the options for students to register and vote safely. The workshop’s topics included: why it’s important to vote, how to register in California, COVID-19 voting precautions, and where to find unbiased news sources.
											<br> </br>
											<i>"The Voting Workshop covered all the basic things we need to legally and rightfully voice our opinions. It was highly educational and even as an international student I feel like I've learned more about the country I am currently living in." </i>
