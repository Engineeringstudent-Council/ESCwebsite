In particular, we strongly recommend that the class is taken alongside Math 53, 54, or 55. We officially assume no prerequisites other than a little calculus (at the level of Math 1A), though we will also appeal to Math 53, 54, and 55 for a few examples. In order to ease the transition, we plan to focus on more of the abstract concepts found in calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. We will delve into these concepts further by focusing on the proofs that arise when constructing these ideas. By the time you complete this course, you will be comfortable with writing proofs at the level required by the core upper-division sequence of Math 110, Math 113, Math 104, and Math 185.

												Course Structure:
												Monday 10am-11:30am Lecture (must attend), 11:30am-12pm Optional Homework Review

Nonlinear dynamics is the vibrant study of often very complicated systems where the change of the output does not depend proportionally on the input, along with its numerous applications throughout many fields. These applications include real-world systems that one can observe directly, such as predator-prey systems, planetary motion, fluids, earthquakes, buildings, electronics, collective behavior, crystallization, and chemical processes, as well as more abstract systems, such as in iterated maps, neural networks, quantum mechanics, and solid-state physics.

												Students who take this course will gain a general understanding of the purpose and significance behind nonlinear analyses of physical and abstract systems, as well as learn about an assortment of analytical and computational tools and techniques used for understanding these systems. Emphasis will be placed on applications of these techniques to systems found throughout many subjects. Hence, hopefully, the knowledge gained from this class will not only be of use throughout one's coursework, but also in one's current or future research and practice.  </td>

Students will learn effective system, schematic, and layout design through hands-on applications and will be exposed to various advanced concerns such as DFx, grounding, decoupling, EMC/EMI, and thermal management.

Where would our food be grown? What would we call “waste”?
												This course will focus on providing a broad overview of green architecture and urban development, engaging with the technical, politico-economic, and socio-cultural aspects of the subjects. Also, a goal of this class is to equip students to earn their LEED Green Associate accreditation through providing the tools to study for the exam. Students will be able to explain and understand the fundamental aspects of the LEED rating system, present their understanding of course topics to others, relate knowledge from outside sources to in-class subjects, and differentiate between solutions that are “good” or “less bad” for the environment.

												Some details on class format and assignments: weekly class meetings will feature guest speakers and include in-class discussion.

								<h3 style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;font-size:12pt;">The DeCal Program (or just DeCal) is an aggregate of student-run courses at the University of California, Berkeley – here, students create and facilitate their own classes on a variety of subjects, many of which are not addressed in the traditional curriculum. All of these courses are PNP and are usually taken for units as the subject matter.</h3>
